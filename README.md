  Potion Recipe:
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  * 2 oz Gin                                           
  * 1/2 oz Elderflower Liqueur (like St-Germain)      
  * 3/4 oz Pineapple Juice                           
  * 1/2 oz Lime Juice                                  
  * 1/2 tsp Grenadine Syrup
 
  Combine all ingredients (except grenadine) in a shaker filled with ice.
  Shake well and strain into a chilled coupe glass.
  Slowly pour the grenadine syrup down the back of a bar spoon,
  allowing it to settle at the bottom to create a sunrise effect.
               Enjoy your Sunrise Sparkler!
